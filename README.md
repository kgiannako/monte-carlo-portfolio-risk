Monte Carlo simulations for portfolio VaR and CVaR estimation.

## Monte Carlo Portfolio Risk Estimation
This project uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate portfolio risk metrics like Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR (CVaR).
It includes exploratory data analysis, risk metric calculation, and comparison with traditional parametric methods.
